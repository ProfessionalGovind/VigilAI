VigilAI: A Comparative Study of Object Detection Models

Project Overview
This is the repository for my personal project, VigilAI. The goal is to develop a real-time computer vision system that compares two different object detection models: YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN. I will be evaluating their performance for key surveillance analytics like crowd density and pedestrian flow.
